This is a demo of my SMP project. Errors are kept as-is; the only thing done was to move everything over.

Best viewed with Internet Explorer or Chrome.

Known bugs:

1. Firefox cannot recognise the font

2. "Return to Home" animation is glitchy

"Guide" section bugs:

1. If you click on step x, then click on step y, then click on step x again, the screen blanks out. E.g. click on step 1, then click on step 4, then click on step 1 again. The screen will blank out.

2. Swiping - swiping backwards once results in a blank screen. When swiped again, the screen will appear with the step 2 steps ago. E.g. swipe from step 3 to step 2: blank screen. Swipe again: step 1 appears.

3. The scrolling on step 4 and 5 is unreliable. Zoom out for the "Return to Home" button to appear on step 5.
